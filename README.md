# Death-to-COVID

Jie Yu, Narayan Khanal, Jason Mejia and I worked on this project for CSc 59866 Senior Design. We wanted to understand the effects of COVID-19 spread in different populations. We chose to simulate populations in Florida and compare to the same in New York.

One of the most surprising facts we learned about the hospital system in connection with our simulations was that there are only 2.9 hospital beds per 100,000 people in New York and / or Florida.

We used pygame for this project, and personally, one of the joys of this project came from the realization that all UI buttons and other input controls are activated by a bounds check along with click detection.
